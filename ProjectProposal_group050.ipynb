    "To avoid the worst effects of global warming, the international community should take unprecedented action to limit the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius instead of the previous target of 2 degrees, according to the October 8, 2018 report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)[^IPCC]. The report also emphasizes the relevance of changing living and consumption habits to climate change, including reducing energy consumption in daily life and changing travel patterns, such as reducing the use of private cars and switching to public transport, walking, or cycling. So, transportation probably is the single largest source of global warming emissions and air pollution in a state. \n",
    "\n",
    "In California, transportation accounts for approximately 50% of greenhouse gas emissions (fuel production emissions) and 80% of air pollutants[^ca.gov]. The new regulation accelerates requirements that automakers deliver an increasing number of zero-emission light-duty vehicles each year beginning in 2026. Sales of new ZEVs and PHEVs will start at 35% that year, build to 68% in 2030, and reach 100% in 2035.[^ca.gov]. Therefore, Considering environmental protection and government subsidies and policies, electric vehicles will become more and more popular in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the trend that electric vehicles are only increasing, we intend to study the efficiency(Wh/km) of electric vehicles to estimate the additional amount of electricity that California needs to provide or the number of additional power stations that need to be built in California in the future. However, in 2021, California's natural gas-fired electric generation accounted for over 50% of in-state generation, while total renewable generation, as shown in the California Power Mix, stood at about 35%[^energy]. Therefore, to better plan the construction of new energy generation, it is necessary to analyze the efficiency of electric vehicles.\n",

    "  **There are no personal information involved, or terms of use issues with the data we proposed because consumers have the right to know the performance and attributes of the vehicles. All of the data we obtained is from ev-database.org. The data does not involve any trade secrets, and they are merely some physical variables. There might be some potential biases, such as the sample we selected cannot represent the population.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **We collected the data based on 'most viewed' on the ev-database.org website, since we believe the more popular an electric car is the more people will search for it, so it should rank higher in most viewed. This may be a potential bias, because we don't know the 'most viewed' algorithm behind the scene. To avoid this potential bias, we'd better make the sample as big as possible. Also, We do not know how they get the test data of these cars, they may come from the official website, or they may be tested by some experiments. This is the biggest risk because we can't guarantee the accuracy of the data. Hence, We can only ensure the accuracy of the data to the greatest extent by comparing the data on the official website.**\n",

    "- How will you set out to detect these specific biases before, during, and after/when communicating your analysis?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Before the analysis, we will collect samples as many as we can. During the analysis, we will use graphs, such as scatter plots, to see if there exists some outliers that cannot reasonbly explained. After the analysis, we will use some physical laws or watching some videos shared by EV owners, i.e. the actual condition of EV vehicles usage, to examine the reasonableness of the linear regression equation.**\n",

    "- Are there any other issues related to your topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Data privacy is not a big problem in terms of the physical properties of the vehicles. However, there may be some equitable impacts that may cause a wrong conclusion. In fact, the range of an electric car is affected by many things, including the battery management technology, the quality of the car's motor, and the power consumption of the air conditioner. However, we are not able to access these data, and therefore, we cannot come up with a very precise conslusion about efficiency(Wh/km). It depends on the vehicles and the driving habits of car owners.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- How will you handle issues you identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Firstly, we will collect our data from .gov or .org website. That is, we will try our best to keep the data from authorative sources. Secondly, we will collect samples as many as possible. Thirdly, we will notifiy readers that our conclusion is only an estimation.**"
